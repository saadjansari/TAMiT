# TAMiT
TAMiT (Toolkit for Automated Microtubule Tracking) is a
microtubule detection and tracking software. It was developed
for use with 3D Fission yeast and Budding yeast cells. TAMiT
finds a variety of microtubule-based structures:
* Spindle-Pole Bodies (Fission and Budding yeast)
* Spindles (Fission and Budding yeast)
* Rigid Microtubules (Fission yeast)
* Curved Microtubules (Budding yeast)

TAMiT was designed to be fully automated and written in MATLAB
using Object-Oriented Programing.
