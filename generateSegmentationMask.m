function SegmentationInfo = generateSegmentationMask(image2D)
% generateSegmentationMask: Generates a segmentation mask for a 2D image of
% fission yeast cells.
%
%   Parameters used: sensitivity=0.6 for the wiener2 noise removal filter
%


%   Detailed explanation goes here

% We will employ thresholding and morphological methods to isolate the cell
% cytoplasm signal from the imaging background

% Begin with a wiener filter to reduce the local deviations in noise.
image2D = mat2gray(image2D);
[imWiener, ~] = wiener2(image2D, [3 3]);

% Now, we'll try to even out the intensities in the backgroun and within
% the cell. First, the background. This will be done by opening the image
% with a structural element followed by a reconstuction. Next, the
% cytoplasmic region will be evened out by closing the image followed by a
% reconstruction.

se = strel('disk', 7);
% Open by reconstruction(erosion expands areas starting in the dark regions
% and then going to the bright regions). Reconstruction then uses the
% intensities of the imWiener to reconstruct the image.
Iobr = imreconstruct(imerode(imWiener, se), imWiener);

% Close by reconstruct( this involves a dilation followed by a
% reconstruction). Dilation spreads out the bright regions before the dark
% ones. A reconstruction is done to match the intensities to the original
% image.
Iobrcbr = imcomplement( imreconstruct( imcomplement( imdilate( Iobr, se) ), imcomplement( Iobr) ) );

% now use adaptive thresholding to threshold the background( which may be
% different in different regions of the image). 0.6 has been determined by
% trial and error. This number might be different if the levels of
% background and cytoplasm are changed.
T = adaptthresh(Iobrcbr, 0.6);
imAthresh = imbinarize( Iobrcbr, T);

% The next thing we'll do is to fill holes in the image
imFill = imfill(imAthresh, 'holes');

% Now we have a decently good mask. I think we can do better. Open the
% image with a structural element
se = strel('disk', 2);
imOpen = imopen(imFill, se);

% Remove any small regions that have somehow made it through
imAfilt = bwareafilt( imOpen, [500 Inf]);

% We won't be able to analyze any cells that are attached to the border of
% this field of view since their features may be cut off. We remove cells
% at the border
imCborder = imclearborder( imAfilt);

% We'll make each object convex in the mask. We do this because cells are
% convex in shape, just like baloons are convex. We do this by finding the
% connected components and replacing them by their convex hull.
