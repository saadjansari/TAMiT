%[clusterID] = dbscan(X, minsize, R) implements the DBSCAN clustering algorithm

% Inputs: 
%            X : Nx2 matrix of point coordinates
%      minsize : minimum accepted cluster size
%            R : neighborhood search radius
%
% Outputs:
%    clusterID : cluster identifier/class number for each point in X
%           nn : #neighbors within R for each point
